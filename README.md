## Notes

This lab was definitely more challenging than the week before. I still need to learn how to spot patterns in encryption methods. For example, a student was able to figure out that a challenge needed three rounds of decoding but I wouldn't have gotten that challenge without his help.

## Installation Instructions

Setup instructions can be found on the Week 5 Lab page.

It should be noted that any browser can be used; however, Chrome and Firefox have one the most user-friendly Inspect Element interfaces.
